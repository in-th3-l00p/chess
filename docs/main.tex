\section{Introduction}

\textbf{crab-chess} is a chess engine written in the \textit{Rust programming language}.

\subsection{Motivation}
As I am in my final year of high school, I have to present at the end of the school year a programming project of my choice, with the purpose of proving that I grasp the minimum amount of computer science related knowledge. Of course, schools in Romania do not require students that can engineer a chess engine from scratch, but I cannot find a good reason why I should not do it just for \textit{fun and profit}.

\subsection{Target}
What I am referring to as a \textit{"chess engine"} might seem pretty simple at first glance. However, there are so many ways of implementing such a computer program, some more clever than others, that I simply shouldn't getting in-depth on implementation details without defining first what I am aiming to develop within this madness.
