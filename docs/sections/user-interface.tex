\section{User interface}

Might make the process more enjoyable.

\subsection{Graphics library}

Decided to go with \href{https://macroquad.rs/}{Macroquad}, as it was simple enough to not be considered a game engine,
leaving everything related to the code structure to the developer (me).

\subsection{Code structure}

Everything related to the user interface is implemented in the \textit{cargo::ui} module.

\subsubsection{Background}

For rendering the background, I have used the following colors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For black: \colorbox{myblack}{\textcolor{white}{\textbf{\#b58863}}}
    \item For white: \colorbox{mywhite}{\textbf{\#f0d9b5}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pieces}

Used assets from the following itch page: \url{https://dsphynx.itch.io/chess-pieces-16x16}
